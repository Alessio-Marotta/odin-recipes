    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
             Margherita pizza is a beloved Italian classic, featuring a thin, golden crust topped with a vibrant tomato sauce, 
        <br> melted mozzarella cheese, and fresh basil leaves. The simple combination of ingredients creates a harmony of flavors, 
        <br> where the tangy sauce complements the creamy cheese, and the aromatic basil adds a fresh, herbaceous note.  
        <br> Baked until  the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned, this pizza offers a satisfying blend of textures and tastes that 
        <br> exemplify the beauty of traditional Italian cuisine.

        <li>1 ½ cups warm water (110°F/45°C)</li>
        <li>3 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the Topping:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup homemade or store-bought pizza sauce</li>
        <li>2 cups fresh mozzarella, sliced</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups fresh basil leaves</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Optional: Grated Parmesan cheese for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Prepare the Dough:
            <ul>
                <li>In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast and sugar in warm water. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until frothy.</li>
                <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the center and add the yeast mixture and olive oil.</li>
                <li>Mix until the dough starts to come together, then knead on a floured surface for about 8-10 minutes, until smooth and elastic.</li>
                <li>Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours, or until doubled in size.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Preheat the Oven:
            <ul>
                <li>Preheat your oven to its highest temperature (usually around 475°F/245°C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven to heat up.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Shape the Dough:
            <ul>
                <li>Punch down the dough to release air, then divide it into two equal portions. Roll each portion into a ball.</li>
                <li>On a floured surface, stretch and roll out the dough into a circle about 12 inches in diameter. Transfer the dough to a pizza peel or baking sheet dusted with flour or cornmeal.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Assemble the Pizza:
            <ul>
                <li>Spread a thin layer of pizza sauce over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges for the crust.</li>
                <li>Arrange the mozzarella slices evenly over the sauce. Scatter fresh basil leaves on top.</li>
                <li>Drizzle the pizza with olive oil and season with salt and pepper.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake:
            <ul>
                <li>Slide the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone or baking sheet. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve:
            <ul>
                <li>Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing. For an extra touch, sprinkle with grated Parmesan and a few more fresh basil leaves.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
