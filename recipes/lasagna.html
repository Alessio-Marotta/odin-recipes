    <h2>Description :</h2>
    <p>Zucchini lasagna is a fresh and flavorful twist on the traditional Italian lasagna. Instead of pasta, 
        <br>thin slices of zucchini are layered to create a lighter and low-carb version of this classic comfort food. 
        <br> The dish combines rich homemade or store-bought tomato sauce, creamy béchamel sauce, and a blend of 
        <br> mozzarella and Parmigiano Reggiano cheeses. Fresh basil adds a fragrant herbal note, while the zucchini 
        <br> provides a tender and slightly sweet base. Baked until golden brown and bubbly, this dish offers a satisfying 
        <br> combination of flavors and textures, making it a delicious and healthier alternative to regular lasagna.

    <h2>Ingredients :</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 zucchini</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups homemade or store-bought tomato sauce</li>
        <li>⅔ cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups bechamel sauce</li>
        <li>1 cup grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese</li>
        <li>¼ cup fresh basil, chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Cut zucchini lengthwise into 1/4-inch thick slices with a knife or mandolin.</li>
        <li>Pour 2 tablespoons tomato sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. 
            <br> Arrange zucchini slices in a single layer, slightly overlapping, over tomato sauce.</li>
        <li>Top with a thin layer of mozzarella, 1/3 of the bechamel (see Editor's Note), 1/3 of remaining 
            <br>tomato sauce, 1/3 of the Parmigiano Reggiano cheese, and 1/3 of the basil. Repeat layers, 
            <br> topping with bechamel and Parmigiano Reggiano cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until sauce is bubbly and the top is golden brown, about 35 minutes. 
            <br> Allow to set until remaining liquid is absorbed, about 10 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
